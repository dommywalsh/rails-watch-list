Watch List is a Ruby on Rails application that allows you to keep track of your favorite movies and TV shows. It is a work in progress, but the basic functionality is there. A user is able to create a list, add their favourite movies to it, and leave reviews.

The main technologies used are Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap.
